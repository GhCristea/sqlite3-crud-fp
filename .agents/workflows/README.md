# Workflows

Workflows are step-by-step procedures for common development tasks.

## Available Workflows

| Workflow | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `commit.md` | `/commit` | Safe commit with typecheck + lint + test |
| `review.md` | `/review` | Code review against FP + immutability standards |
| `tdd.md` | `/tdd` | Test-driven development: red → green → refactor |
